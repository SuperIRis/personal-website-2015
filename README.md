# Basic Starter

This is my start point for a regular project (no JS framework).

It is based in Google Starter Kit, but was modified to suit my personal taste for directory structure, CSS framework, and other details.

It includes Compass** and SASS for CSS, JSHint and Uglify for JS, all in Gulp tasks.

** Due to a bug in the gulp-compass plugin, I had to remove until it is fixed :(
